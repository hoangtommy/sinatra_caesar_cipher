This project was an itroduction to the sinatra framework and MVC concepts. It brings the caesar_cipher program to life with a simple form UI.

## Project Reflection
1. The hardest part was getting use to the routes and templates concept of MVC. The implementation of the app was simple enough.
2. I opted to not dress up the UI in favor of moving forward in the curriculum.
